It is often used to startle or surprise someone, which can be related to the vast and mysterious nature of the cosmos. In the vastness of space, there are countless phenomena that can be both awe-inspiring and surprising, from the birth of new stars to the collision of galaxies. So, while \"boo\" may seem simple on the surface, it can also serve as a reminder of the unexpected wonders that lie beyond our own planet."
