# Outline of `app.py`

## Imports
- Flask for creating the web server and handling HTTP requests.
- os for interacting with the operating system.
- json for JSON parsing and serialization.
- datetime for working with dates and times.
- threading for running tasks in separate threads.
- `llm.get_completion` for making calls to a language model.
- CORS from flask_cors for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- ThreadPoolExecutor and as_completed from concurrent.futures for asynchronous task execution.

## ThreadPoolExecutor Configuration
- Sets up a ThreadPoolExecutor for making asynchronous calls to the language model.

## Flask App Configuration
- Initializes the Flask application.
- Configures CORS with specific origins and support for credentials.

## Constants
- Defines `LOGS_DIR` for storing log files.
- Defines `TASK_FILE_PATH` for the task configuration JSON file.

## Directory Setup
- Checks and creates the `LOGS_DIR` directory if it does not exist.

## Utility Functions
- `write_log` function to write a log entry to a file in the `LOGS_DIR`.

## Flask Routes
- `/tasks` route for handling task retrieval and updates via GET and POST methods.
- `/process_text` route for processing text via POST method (currently a placeholder).
- `/submit` route for handling the submission of tasks and user text via POST and OPTIONS methods, including asynchronous execution of tasks and logging.

## Error Handling
- Includes try-except blocks to handle file not found and other exceptions, returning appropriate JSON responses and HTTP status codes.

## Main Block
- Checks if the script is the main module and runs the Flask app with debug mode enabled (not recommended for production).
