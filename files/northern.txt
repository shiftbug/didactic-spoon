When these giants became aware of the existence of the god Buri, and
of his son Börr (born), whom he had immediately produced, they began
waging war against them, for as the gods and giants represented the
opposite forces of good and evil, there was no hope of their ever
coming to an agreement and living together in peace. This struggle
continued evidently for ages, neither party gaining a decided
advantage, until Börr married the giantess Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn
(the thorn of evil), who bore him three powerful sons, Odin (spirit),
Vili (will), and Ve (holy). These three sons immediately joined their
father in his struggle against the inimical frost giants, and finally
succeeded in slaying their deadliest foe, the great Ymir. As he sank
down lifeless the blood gushed from his wounds in such floods that
it produced a great deluge, in which all his race perished, with the
exception of Bergelmir, who escaped in a boat and went with his wife to
the confines of the world.
