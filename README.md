# React + Vite

app.jsx takes user input and a prompt catalog and passes it to app.py which opens a log, pulls setttings for each task from a jsom, and gets completion for each task from llm.py before passing the completion back to the app.jsx for display to the user and closing the log file with the completion data added.
